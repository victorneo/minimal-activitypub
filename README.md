## Minimum ActivityPub Server

This is an implementation of a mini ActivityPub server based on [timmot's
ActivityPub Tutorial][1] using FastAPI.

I am mainly using this repository as a reference / boilerplate for my future
experiments, but you are welcome to browse and use what you need.


## Steps

1. Fill up the empty params in `app.py`
2. Generate your public and private key and fill in `public.py`
